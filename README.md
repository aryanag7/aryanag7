# üëã Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I'm Aryan Agrawal, and I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Indiana University, Bloomington, and I‚Äôm an ex SWE Intern at Gametime Hero. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that have allowed me to explore a variety of technologies and cloud solutions, and most importantly, make a tangible impact.

I believe that every line of code has the potential to improve something, whether it's optimizing costs, enhancing user experience, or building solutions that scale. I'm not just about writing code‚ÄîI focus on creating value and delivering solutions that solve meaningful challenges.

## üöÄ Previously @Gametime Hero - SWE Intern

My first industry internship = tons of learning beyond just syntax. I got comfortable in a big codebase, wrote small, clean modules, and learned how good pull requests + feedback loops keep teams fast. Team ritual: demo-o‚Äôclock‚Äîshow a tiny win, snag quick feedback, and ship it. Also mastered the ancient art of turning ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù into ‚Äúworks on everyone‚Äôs machine.‚Äù üòÑ

My big win: I built a platform-level translation system so the app can speak multiple languages consistently. One place to manage copy, instant language switching in the UI, and an easy path for new pages to ‚Äújust work‚Äù with translations‚Äîless duplicate effort, more consistency, and future languages made simple.

To keep things sturdy, I added tests around translations, directive bindings, and reactive forms. I also wired organizer sign-ups into ClickUp (auto-tasks with context) and cleaned up issues that caused stale screens or duplicate actions‚Äîfewer hard refreshes, smoother flows, happier users.

Tech I enjoyed: Angular + TypeScript (Signals/RxJS), Firebase, Git/GitHub, ClickUp.


## üåç What I've Built

### AWS Cloud Cost Optimization Chatbot

I've always believed that cloud optimization can be a game-changer for businesses, especially when dealing with large-scale infrastructures. That's why I created a serverless AWS chatbot using AWS Lex, Lambda, and SageMaker. The chatbot provides real-time EC2 rightsizing recommendations, helping users reduce cloud costs by offering data-driven insights.

With over 100 queries processed and a 97% Lambda success rate, this project taught me how cloud solutions can be efficiently leveraged to create value, both for users and businesses.

### Home Stay Platform

I built this full-stack homestay platform to demonstrate how technology can simplify the booking experience for both hosts and guests. With Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, I implemented secure user authentication, image uploads using Cloudinary, and integrated Mapbox for interactive maps.

The result? A seamless experience for users, with a 25% reduction in listing creation time, improving the overall efficiency for hosts. This project was a perfect example of how thoughtful engineering can create a better user experience.

### Language Agnostic Visualization Web App

The world is more connected than ever, and language should never be a barrier. That's why I created this language-agnostic Angular web app, allowing users to select languages and input code efficiently. It integrates Angular with Material UI, providing users with a smooth, dynamic experience‚Äîwhether they're coding in Java, Python, or any other language.

This project reinforced the importance of building flexible solutions that adapt to diverse user needs, especially when it comes to multi-lingual and multi-platform applications.

## üéØ The Challenges I Enjoy

I'm constantly diving into new challenges that push me to think critically about how technology can solve real-world problems. Whether it's optimizing AWS costs, building responsive front-end applications, or experimenting with machine learning models, I enjoy tackling complex issues and delivering solutions that matter.

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- Deepening my understanding of cloud technologies, particularly AWS Lambda and SQS for serverless architectures.
- Working on projects in Angular and React.js to build dynamic and interactive user experiences.
- Exploring more about deep learning models for NLP and improving text classification accuracy.

## üì¨ Let's Connect

Technology is all about collaboration. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and build innovative solutions together. If you're passionate about cloud computing, AI, or software development, feel free to reach out. Let's make something great!

## ‚ö° Fun Facts

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Watching Test cricket, my favorite sport to follow.
- Enjoying movies and TV series (huge fan of binge-watching).
- Playing football, cricket, badminton, and pickleball.
- Spending time with myself, reflecting on new ideas and learning about the world.
